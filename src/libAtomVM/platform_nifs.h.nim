##  @brief    Returns the Nif assocatiated with a nif name.
##
##  @details  This function is used to locate platform-specific Nifs.
##            Each platform must include an implementation of this function,
##            even if it just returns NULL.
##  @param    nifname a null-terminated module:function/arity name
##  @return   the Nif structure associated with the supplied nif name, or
##            NULL, if there is no such Nif.
