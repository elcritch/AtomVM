##  @brief Gets a term from external term data.
##
##  @details Deserialize an external term from external format and returns a term.
##  @param external_term the external term that will be deserialized.
##  @param ctx the context that owns the memory that will be allocated.
##  @param use_heap_fragment if non-zero, use a heap fragment to store the generated
##  terms.  Otherwise, use the heap in the provided context.  Note that when using the
##  context heap, this function may call the GC, if there is insufficient space to
##  store the generated terms.
##  @returns a term.
##

##  @brief Create a term from a binary.
##
##  @details Deserialize a binary term that stores term data in Erlang external term format,
##  and instantiate the serialized terms.  The heap from the context will be used to
##  allocate the instantiated terms.  This function is the complement of externalterm_to_binary.
##  WARNING: This function may call the GC, which may render the input binary invalid.
##  @param ctx the context that owns the memory that will be allocated.
##  @param binary the binary
##  @param bytes_read the number of bytes read from the input binary
##  @param num_extra_terms the number of words (terms) to (possibly) allocate space for
##  in the heap, prior to instantiating the destination term (may trigger GC).
##  @returns the term deserialized from the input term, or an invalid term, if
##  deserialization fails.
##
